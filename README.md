#TODAY'S VIBE

## IDEA
Web application that allows a user to create a list of activities or "Vibes" they like to do that will be linked to a location and times of operation making it quicker and easier for the user to see if their desired activity is possible to do at the moment, or see when the activity will be possible to do.

## MVP
- User can register/login
- User can create or delete a "Vibe" (activity)
- User will be able to connect "Vibe" to a location using a mapping API
- Each "Vibe" will display times of operation

## FUTURE FEATURES
- User will be able to sort "Vibes"
- A first glance identification of weather a "Vibe" is open or closed
- User can edit "Vibe"
- User can use link on each "Vibe" to get directions
